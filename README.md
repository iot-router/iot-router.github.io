# [IoT-Router Requirements](https://fkroepfl.github.io/IoT-Router/)
Joint creation of a requirements convention for an affordable mobile IoT Internet router and for hosting IoT agents for Smart Home and other third-party applications to create synergies between industries and projects.

## Introduction

This document is a requirement specification for a hosting router device to run consumer IoT applications, like Smart Home Gateway Clients and other 3rd party apps, in a virtual environment, e.g. container (isolated namespace), on it. A Smart Home Client is a well known part of a gateway based Smart Home platform. Further clients and agents will be named as examples step by step depending on the feedback.

**Main ideas**

- One box for multiple applications in a secure environment.
- All relevant and trendy home automation technologies integrated.
- Powerful mobile broadband connection with LAN dual path option.

**But still extremely affordable!**

To be able to work close to the kernel, but still run 3rd party apps in a completely isolated environment and ensure high portability and security, containers must be used.

Although the documents presented here were primarily prepared as a binding supplement to the tendering procedures, they are also suitable for general agreement on the content of the requirements between industrial partners.

All industry participants who become aware of these documents are kindly requested to contact their customers and/or partners in order to discuss the synergy potential or to participate in the further development of the convention presented here.
